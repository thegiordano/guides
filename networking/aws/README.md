## Networking Overview

### VPC

### Advanced services
#### VPC Gateway Endpoint
Purpose: Allows private connectivity to S3 and DynamoDB from within your VPC.
Type: Operates at the gateway level.
Targeted Services:
- S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)
- DynamoDB

How It Works:
- Adds a route to your route table, directing traffic for the target service (e.g., S3) through the endpoint.
- Does not use private IP addresses within your subnet.
- Traffic remains within the AWS network.
Cost: No additional charge beyond the data transfer charges.
Configuration:
- Simple to set up by creating a gateway endpoint and updating route tables.
- No need for additional network interfaces in your VPC.

Use Case:
- Access S3 or DynamoDB from within your VPC securely and efficiently.

#### VPC Interface Endpoint
Purpose: Enables private connectivity to most AWS services and some third-party services via AWS PrivateLink.
Type: Operates at the interface level.
Targeted Services:
- A wide range of AWS services (e.g., EC2, API Gateway, Kinesis, Lambda, etc.).
- Some third-party services available in AWS Marketplace.

How It Works:
- Creates one or more elastic network interfaces (ENIs) in your VPC.
- ENIs use private IP addresses from your subnet.
- Traffic between your VPC and the service is routed through these ENIs.
Cost:
- Charged for each hour that the endpoint is active and for data processing through the endpoint.
Configuration:
- Requires assigning private IP addresses to ENIs in subnets.
- Security groups can be attached to the ENIs for access control.

Use Case:
- Access AWS services that donâ€™t support gateway endpoints.
- Use for more granular control with security groups and private IPs.

#### Transit Gateway
Purpose: Simplifies connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks using a centralized hub-and-spoke model.
Type: AWS-managed network infrastructure.
Capabilities:
- Facilitates VPC-to-VPC communication (even with overlapping CIDRs).
- Allows on-premises network-to-VPC connectivity.
- Acts as a scalable central hub for routing traffic.

How It Works:
- All connected VPCs and on-premises networks communicate through the transit gateway, avoiding the public internet.
- Route tables within the transit gateway determine the flow of traffic between VPCs and on-premises networks.
Cost:
- Charges based on the number of attachments (per hour) and the amount of data transferred.
Configuration:
- Requires setting up attachments (e.g., VPC attachment, VPN attachment, Direct Connect).
- Configuring route tables to control how traffic flows between connected networks.

Use Cases:
- Large-scale, multi-VPC environments.
- Connecting on-premises networks to multiple VPCs.

#### AWS VPC Peering
Purpose: Provides a direct, one-to-one private connection between two VPCs.
Type: Peer-to-peer connection.
Capabilities:
- Enables communication between two VPCs privately.
- VPCs can be in the same AWS region or different regions.

How It Works:
- A peering connection is established between two VPCs.
- Route tables are updated to enable communication between the VPCs.
- No transitive routing: Traffic cannot flow between VPCs indirectly (e.g., A -> B -> C).
Cost:
- No hourly charges for maintaining the connection.
- Data transfer charges apply only for traffic across VPCs in different AZs or Regions.
Configuration:
- Requires creating a peering connection.
- Updating route tables in both VPCs to allow communication.
- No overlap in CIDR blocks is allowed.

Use Cases:
- Direct connection between two specific VPCs.
